            <h3>BECOME A FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER</h3>
            <p>
                web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the
                scenes to
                make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

                Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use
                depends on
                the
                types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

                Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great
                career
                option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional
                university
                degree to become qualified.
